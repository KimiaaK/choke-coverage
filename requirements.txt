# Requirements for Choke Coverage Analysis

The project relies on Python libraries for image processing, numerical operations, and visualization.
Below are the dependencies that need to be installed for the project to work properly.

```
numpy==1.23.5
pillow==9.3.0
matplotlib==3.7.1
```

### Explanation:
- **numpy**: For numerical operations on image data, like array manipulations and calculations.
